# Princess-Parasol

Princess Parasol is a 2D platformer that has you collecting gems and shooting ghosts with your parasol gun! (A gunbrella, if you will).

Controls: Left and right arrow keys to move, up arrow to jump, spacebar to shoot

Dev Log: Designed all art assets, movement controls based off of Create with Code, projectiles, designed an offset for projectiles so they would shoot out of the end of the character's umbrella instead of her torso, a spawner for ghosts based off of Create with Code, ghosts that despawn when hit by the player or a bullet, and gem collectables that only despawn when touched by the player. 

All art assets are original works created on Pixilart.com
